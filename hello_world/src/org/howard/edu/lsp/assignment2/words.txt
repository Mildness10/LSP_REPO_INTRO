The developer doesn't know if the system.out.print works. He tried the system.out.print again, but it doesn't show any output. He'll debug the system.out.print later, but he doesn't think it'll work.
Also, he realized the developer's job isn't easy, but the results are rewarding.
System.out.print can be tricky to debug, but with practice, the developer becomes better.
